# film_society_website
A final project for our CS201 web development class.

This website allows Clark University students to organize film projects. Students with access to the application may add film projects of their own to the site with details such as desired roles, the synopsis, current applicants and available roles. Students may also apply to projects on the site and add their preffered roles and contact information.
